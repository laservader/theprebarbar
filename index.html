          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p>Everyone knows the feeling, you wake up the next day, remember (or don't) how much fun you had, then get slammed by a headache. You can hardly do anything for the rest of the morning but drink water and think about how awful you feel. What you would give to have not gotten so trashed. The pre-bar bar is for all those nights and all those mornings. Eat it before you start drinking, and you will find that those mornings don't happen anymore (but those nights still do).
          </p>
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>Our goals are simple, we want everyone to have access to a delicious bar that prevents your hangover, so you can enjoy tomorrow as much as tonight. We hope to partner with fraternities, sororities, and bars across college towns to get the pre-bar bar to the people who want it most. </p>

          The mission of The Pre-Bar Bar is to prevent your hangover. Our vision is for our bar to be ubiqituous across college towns, both in greek life and outside of it.
