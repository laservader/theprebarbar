              The Pre-Bar Bar is a granola based bar that helps to prevent a hangover. Eaten before you start drinking, the special ingredients in the bar help combat some of the toxins from alcohol that make you feel terrible in the morning. Started in Gainesville, FL and expanding to major college towns like Madison, WI, Southbend, IN, and Boulder, CO, the pre-bar bar is a delicious way to start off your night right, and start your next day off strong.
              <br>
              <h2> How does it work?</h2>
               When you eat the bar, about 30-45 minutes later our special ingredients reach their peak concentration in your body, these ingredients help your body deal with acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a chemical that your body makes when it breaks down alcohol, and is actually 10-20 times more toxic than alcohol itself. As you can guess, acetaldehyde is one of the reasons you feel hungover the next day and is what our bar targets to prevent your next hangover.
