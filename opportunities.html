              <h3>Ambassadors</h3>
              We are currently looking for motivated applicants to be the ambassadors of our product across campuses. These ambassadors will be given a vast amount of freedom to sell product and spread brand awareness.
              The program will focus heavily on commissions and incentives, meaning that those who are skilled and put in the time have the opporitinuty to make considerable money.
              Commissions of up to 50% will be rewarded, and incentives will be awarded as marks are hit. For those interested, please reach out!
